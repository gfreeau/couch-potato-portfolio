I needed a simple tool to keep track of investments.

This tool will read a configuration file and retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance and display it in a table.

See `config/config.json.dist` for an example configuration file.

The tool runs on the command line only, run it by executing `php app.php`. It requires php7.
